* Stratege
  Stratege is a strategy based term rewriting library for clojure, which is based on the following ideas:
  - operate on terms through zippers.
  - separate rules from strategies using composeable strategy combinators like StrategoXT does.
  - strategies are written in a cps style so that they don't blow up the stack.
